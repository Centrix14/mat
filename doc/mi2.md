# Guide to using the mi2 interactive interpreter.

## What is mi2?
mi2 -- is an interactive interpreter of the mat language, which can be used to write small programs and check their correct operation.

## How to run mi2?
To begin, compile the source code using the make utility, how to do it is told [here](main.md). Then run mi2 command `mi2`.

## How to use mi2?
If you did everything correctly after starting mi2 will display information about yourself, then you will see a prompt in the version mi2 v0.2.x it looks like this:

```c
mi2> 
```

As soon as you see the prompt and the cursor blinking next to it, you can type commands like in a normal mat.

**Example**

```c
mi2> :8/2+90-6r
88
mi2> 
```

In this session, after the invitation, I wrote a mini-program, and then received its result - 88.

# If you do not succeed, do all the procedures first, and if it does not help, then write to me, e-mail [here](main.md).
