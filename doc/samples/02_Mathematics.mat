Sample 2. Mathematics

In this lesson, we will look at the application of mathematics in mat 
The following calculation modes are supported in mat (+, -, *, /, :, neg, abs, sqrt, ^)
~

~ To begin, consider the calculation of the expression 2+(2*2) ~
:2 ~ Initialize accumulator 2 ~
*2 ~ Multiply the value of the accumulator 2 ~
+2r ~ Add 2 and display the value of the accumulator. ~

~ And also calculate the value of the expression (2+2)*2 ~
:2 ~ Initialize accumulator 2 ~
+2 ~ Add 2  ~
*2r ~ Multiply 2 and display the value of the accumulator. ~

~ Therefore, the above expressions have different meanings 6 != 8 ~

~ Now calculate the following expression: (|-5| + 2)^2 (49) ~
:5 neg abs ~ Change the battery value, change the value to the opposite and calculate the module of this value. ~
+2 ~ Add 2 ~
^2r ~ Squared, and display the value on the screen  ~

~ Finally, we display the value of this expression: sqrt(|-89|-15+6*2/4^4) (1600) ~
:89 neg abs -15+6*2/4^4 sqrt r
