Sample 2. Mathematics

In this lesson, we will look at the application of mathematics in mat 
The following calculation modes are supported in mat (+, -, *, /)
~

~ To begin, consider the calculation of the expression 2+(2*2) ~
:2 ~ Initialize accumulator 2 ~
*2 ~ Multiply the value of the accumulator 2 ~
+2r ~ Add 2 and display the value of the accumulator. ~

~ And also calculate the value of the expression (2+2)*2 ~
:2 ~ Initialize accumulator 2 ~
+2 ~ Add 2  ~
*2r ~ Multiply 2 and display the value of the accumulator. ~

~ Therefore, the above expressions have different meanings 6 != 8 ~
