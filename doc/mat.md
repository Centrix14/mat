# Guide to using the mfi file interpreter.

To run a program on mat using mfi, use the command `mat filename.mat`. Please note that mfi can interpret only one program in one pass.
To make sure that you have done everything correctly, copy the text below into test.mat
```c
output
A new line
~ A single line ~
:8/2+90-6r

```

If you have done everything correctly you will see the following message:

```c

A new line
88

```
